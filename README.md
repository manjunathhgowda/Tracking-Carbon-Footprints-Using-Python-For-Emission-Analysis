# Tracking-Carbon-Footprints-Using-Python-For-Emission-Analysis

This project analyzes carbon emissions across Indian states from 2010 to 2024 using Python's data analytics and visualization libraries. It focuses on the key greenhouse gases: COâ‚‚ (Carbon Dioxide), CO (Carbon Monoxide), and CHâ‚„ (Methane). The study addresses regional disparities, sectoral contributions, and temporal trends through an interactive dashboard designed to support informed policymaking and sustainable development goals.
